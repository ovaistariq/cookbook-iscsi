# Retry

# To specify the number of times iscsid should retry a login
# if the login attempt fails due to the node.conn[0].timeo.login_timeout
# expiring modify the following line. Note that if the login fails
# quickly (before node.conn[0].timeo.login_timeout fires) because the network
# layer or the target returns an error, iscsid may retry the login more than
# node.session.initial_login_retry_max times.
#
# This retry count along with node.conn[0].timeo.login_timeout
# determines the maximum amount of time iscsid will try to
# establish the initial login. node.session.initial_login_retry_max is
# multiplied by the node.conn[0].timeo.login_timeout to determine the
# maximum amount.
#
# The default node.session.initial_login_retry_max is 8 and
# node.conn[0].timeo.login_timeout is 15 so we have:
#
# node.conn[0].timeo.login_timeout * node.session.initial_login_retry_max =
#								120 seconds
#
# Valid values are any integer value. This only
# affects the initial login. Setting it to a high value can slow
# down the iscsi service startup. Setting it to a low value can
# cause a session to not get logged into, if there are disruptions
# during startup or if the network is not ready at that time.
